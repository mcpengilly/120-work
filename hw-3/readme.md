# Homework 3 Summary

## Starting with p5
I began this week's work by downloading the empty p5 project, unzipping it, duplicating it, and moving the duplicate to the appropriate directory. In this process I created a course-work directory and a week-3 directory within that and I also downloaded the "Open in Browsers" package.

## Hello World Program
Once I had setup my directories as directed by the course website, I opened my sketch.js file and added the code required to print "Hello World". After this I experimented with the ellipse function and tried changing the position and dimensions.  Next I learned the difference between the 'setup' and 'draw' functions.  After this I learned how to create a canvas and set its dimensions as well as its color. After this I committed the changes that I had made and pushed them to my Github repo.

## Summary
The course work from this week was all fairly straight forward and easy to follow along with. Creating a canvas and adding text or shapes to it is pretty simple, but I look forward to making more interactive pieces such as the example video on the p5 website.  I was slightly confused about why we were instructed to create a week-3 directory within a course-work directory, even though we also created a hw-3 directory for the assignment.
